# Reviews

The **Reviews** feature is a core component of [reviewsup.io](https://reviewsup.io).
It enables users to manage and display authentic feedback from customers, users, or supporters, either by **manually adding reviews** or **importing them from third-party platforms**.

Reviews can be customized, organized, and moderated with ease, offering fine-grained control over how they are presented.
