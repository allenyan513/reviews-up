## Step 3: Integrate Reviewsup into Your Project (Next.js Example)

### 1. Install the Package

Run the following command in the root directory of your project to install the Reviewsup React component library [@reviewsup/embed-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reviewsup/embed-react):

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @reviewsup/embed-react
```

---

### 2. Import Global Styles

Add the following line to your `global.css` file to include Reviewsup’s default styles:

```css
@import '@reviewsup/embed-react/styles.css';
```

---

### 3. Embed the Component

Import and use the component on any page where you want to display reviews:

```tsx
'use client';
import './global.css';
import { ShowcaseClient } from '@reviewsup/embed-react';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ShowcaseClient showcaseId={'YOUR_WIDGET_ID'} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> Replace `'YOUR_WIDGET_ID'` with the actual Widget ID from your Reviewsup dashboard.

### 4. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start your app:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

You should now see the Reviewsup review widget rendered on your page.
