# Widgets

**Widgets** are the core display units in [reviewsup.io](https://reviewsup.io), allowing you to embed curated user reviews into any website or app with minimal setup.
You can customize the appearance, behavior, and data source of each widget to match your brand and design goals.

---

## 1. What is a Widget?

A **widget** is an embeddable component that displays selected reviews on your site. You can think of it as a "review showcase" that pulls in content from your Reviews library based on your settings.

Each widget has a unique `widget ID` and can be used multiple times across different pages or platforms.

## 2. Accessing Your Widgets

To manage your widgets:

1. Log in to [reviewsup.io](https://reviewsup.io)
2. Navigate to the **Widgets** tab in the sidebar
3. You will see a list of your existing widgets, including a **Default Widget** created automatically for you

From here, you can:

* View widget details
* Edit appearance and behavior
* Copy the embed code

## 3. Adding a Widget to Your Website

### 3.1 Copy Embed Code

To embed a widget:

1. Click on your desired widget
2. Click the **"Add to your website"** button (top right)
3. Copy the generated HTML or React snippet

You can choose to:

* Embed as a static `<iframe>` or script tag
* Use the React SDK: [`@reviewsup/embed-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reviewsup/embed-react)

---

### 3.2 Using the React SDK (Recommended)

Install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @reviewsup/embed-react
```

Import and use it in your component:

```tsx
'use client';
import { ShowcaseClient } from '@reviewsup/embed-react';

export default function Reviews() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ShowcaseClient showcaseId={'YOUR_WIDGET_ID'} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> Replace `YOUR_WIDGET_ID` with the actual ID from your dashboard.

## 4. Widget Customization

Each widget can be configured to control:

* **Layout** (Flow, Grid, Carousel, Avatar, etc.)
* **Max reviews**: Limit the number of reviews displayed
* **Sort order** (latest, highest-rated, custom)
* **Review filters** (e.g., only featured or with 4+ stars)
* **Auto Dark/Light mode**: Automatically adapt to user preferences
* **Custom Display**: Enable/disable showing rating, date, and other metadata

[//]  # (You can access these options by clicking **Edit Widget** on the widget card.)
All of these settings are available in the left modal, after change any settings, click the **Save** button to apply changes.
