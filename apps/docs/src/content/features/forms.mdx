# Forms

**Forms** allow you to collect user-generated reviews directly from your own website or application, without needing to import them manually or rely on third-party platforms.
They are fully customizable, embeddable, and directly linked to your Reviewsup account.

This is the recommended way to gather authentic feedback, testimonials, or social proof from users, customers, or team members.

## 1. What is a Form in Reviewsup?

A **Form** in Reviewsup is a hosted or embeddable review submission form that you can share via a link or embed into your website. Submissions collected through a Form are automatically added to your Reviews library for approval and display.

## 4. Embedding a Form on Your Website

You can embed the form on your site using the provided iframe or React component.

### Example: Embed via `<iframe>`

```html
<iframe
  src="https://reviewsup.io/form/YOUR_FORM_ID"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
```

### Example: Using React SDK

```tsx
'use client';
import { ReviewForm } from '@reviewsup/embed-react';

export default function CollectFeedback() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ReviewForm formId="YOUR_FORM_ID" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> Replace `"YOUR_FORM_ID"` with the actual ID shown in your dashboard.

## 5. Review Submission Workflow

1. Users fill out and submit the form.
2. The submission is added to your **Reviews** page with `status = hidden` by default.
3. You can review, edit, and approve the review before publishing it to any widget.
4. Approved reviews can be pinned, featured, or styled like any other review.

---

## 6. Use Cases

* Collect testimonials after a purchase or signup
* Ask for feedback after customer support interactions
* Create public "wall of love" pages with real reviews
* Share private form links for beta testers or partners

---

## 7. Best Practices

* Keep forms short to increase completion rates
* Use images or avatars to personalize the experience
* Offer incentives (optional) to encourage more responses
* Share the form link in follow-up emails, newsletters, or in-app popups

---

## 8. Example Link Format

Direct access to a form looks like:

```
https://reviewsup.io/form/YOUR_FORM_ID
```

---

## 9. Coming Soon

We plan to support:

* **Webhooks**: trigger actions on new submissions (e.g. Slack notifications)
* **Captcha** / spam protection
* **Form analytics** (conversion rate, drop-off rate)
* **A/B testing for form designs**
